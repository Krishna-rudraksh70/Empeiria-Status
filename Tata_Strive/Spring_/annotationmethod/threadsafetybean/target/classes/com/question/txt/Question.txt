Scenario-1:
Youâ€™re developing a Spring application where a bean is shared across multiple threads. However, the bean maintains some internal state. How would you address potential thread-safety issues in this scenario?

Follow-up points to consider:
* Describe the default singleton scope in Spring and its implications.
* Explain approaches like making the bean immutable, using prototype scope, or synchronizing access.
* Discuss when you might use alternative scopes (such as request or session) in a web application.
